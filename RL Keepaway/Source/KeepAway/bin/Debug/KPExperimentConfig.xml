    Keepaway evolution    
    Increase complexity by increasing the number of Agents e.g from 4vs3 to 5vs4 (Keeper vs Taker setup).     
    There are 5 variants of methods to adapt the evolutionary search : 
    1. Objective-Based Search - uses average hold time in secs over 30 episodes
    2. Novelty Search - uses behavioral diversity , measured on 3 behavior characterising properties
       - average number of passes, average dispersion of team members and average distance of ball 
       from center of field of play
    3. NS-Hybrid (Novelty + Objective-Based) Search
    4. Genotypic Diversity maintanance Search - It uses compatibility distance measure 
    5. GD-Hybrid (Genotypic Diversity + Objective-Based) Search
    RealFitness is the average hold time defined per genome (over 30 episodes , i.e 30 trials_per_Evaluation)
    
    Table of Keepaway configuration and associated Input-Output ANN configuration :
    3 vs 2 -> 13 - 3 
    4 vs 3 -> 19 - 4
    5 vs 3 -> 23 - 4
    5 vs 4 -> 25 - 5
    6 vs 4 -> 29 - 5
    6 vs 5 -> 31 - 6
    Changing the Keepaway configuration should go with the ANN configuration.
