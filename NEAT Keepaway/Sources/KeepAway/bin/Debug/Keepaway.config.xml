    Transfer - If 'true' means reuse the population of previously trained policies, 
               provided in the main folder as Population.xml file. If 'false' start 
               training from scratch by generating a new population with random weights.
    Seed - If 'true'means seed the initial population with the best genome obtained from 
           previous training. File used is Champ.xml to be placed in the main folder.
